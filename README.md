## Overview

This repository contains a machine learning project that follows a structured workflow using Scikit-Learn. The project incorporates pipelines to streamline the data preprocessing and modeling processes. The primary aim is to provide insights and model predictions based on a selected dataset. Here's a breakdown of the contents and the workflow:

### 1. Introduction
- **Identity**: Details about the author and contributors of this project.
- **Dataset Overview**: A brief description of the dataset used, its source, and its significance.
- **Objective**: The primary goal or outcomes that this project aims to achieve.

### 2. Import Libraries
The first cell of the notebook contains all the necessary libraries used throughout the project, including visualization libraries such as matplotlib and seaborn.

### 3. Data Loading
- This section involves the initial setup of the dataset, which might include renaming columns, checking the size of the dataset, and other preparatory steps. The dataset was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vikramamin/customer-churn-decision-tree-and-random-forest)

### 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Delve into the dataset using various techniques such as querying, grouping, and visualizing the data to gain a deeper understanding.

### 5. Feature Engineering & Pipeline Creation
- Preparing the data for model training. This includes tasks like splitting the data into train and test sets, data transformation (like normalization and encoding), among other necessary processes.
- **Pipelines**: Use of Scikit-Learn pipelines to automate and organize the sequence of preprocessing tasks and model training. This ensures a consistent and reproducible workflow.

### 6. Model Definition
- Definition of the machine learning model, the rationale behind choosing a particular algorithm or model, chosen hyperparameters, the metrics used for evaluation, and other related details.

### 7. Model Training
- Contains code cells dedicated to training the model. Multiple training sessions might be conducted with different hyperparameters to observe various results. The use of pipelines ensures a seamless transition from data preprocessing to model training.

### 8. Model Evaluation
- Evaluate the performance of the model based on the chosen metrics. Visualization of the model's performance trend and/or error rate is also showcased. An analysis based on the training results is also provided.

### 9. Model Saving
- Save the best-performing model, based on the evaluation, for future use and deployment. 

### 10. Model Inference
- Test the trained model on data that wasn't part of either the training or testing sets using the established pipeline. This ensures the model's generalizability to unseen data. Note that this is maintained in a separate notebook.

### 11. Conclusion
- Summarize the findings of the project and reflect upon the set objectives.

### 12. Model Deployment
- Details on how the best-performing model was deployed (to streamlit and HuggingFace) for real-world use or integration into other systems. This might include steps on converting the model to specific formats, setting up cloud-based deployment platforms, API creation, and other related processes to make the model accessible for end-users or other applications.
